# Jordan Gibbs - React Portfolio 

## Creating a portfolio

### User Story

- AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
- SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


### Acceptance Critera

- GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
- WHEN I load the portfolio
- THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
- WHEN I view the header
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
- WHEN I view the navigation titles
- THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
- WHEN I click on a navigation title
- THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
- WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
- THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
- WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
- THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
- WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
- THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
- WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
- THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
- WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
- THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
- WHEN I enter text into the email address field
- THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
- WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
- THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
- WHEN I view the footer
- THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Issues identified and corrected

- Working with React-Bootstrap

I decided to challenge myself on my portfolio and try to learn and utilize as many different bootstrap stylings as a could. As I normally instead would just use my own style.css file I wanted to upskill myself and use this instead. After reading over the documentation each day, I became more confident in using different styling elements which are evident in my work.

## Future work
  
- Updating my Resume (I am changing profession and need to rewrite my entire resume. Previous one was about becoming a primary school sports teacher. In progress)
- Adding more detail into my AboutME accordion once I have completed my coding course

I have added commenting to help any future edits by making it easier to see what the different elements are in the code so that if any collaboration work will be done in the future, it will be easiser to track and change.
